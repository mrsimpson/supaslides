    <p>
      This application revolutionizes remote presentations by enhancing interaction between the
      presenter and the audience. Gone are the days of one-sided webinars and virtual meetings. With
      our app, you can create a dynamic and engaging environment, regardless of physical distances.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits for Presenters</h2>
    <p>
      Presenters can enjoy real-time feedback, interactive Q&A sessions, and live polls. This
      ensures that your message is being understood and keeps your audience engaged. The app also
      provides analytics to help you understand audience engagement and improve future
      presentations.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits for the Audience</h2>
    <p>
      The audience can actively participate through interactive features such as asking questions,
      responding to polls, and providing instant feedback. This not only keeps them engaged but also
      makes the presentation more relevant and interesting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Experience a new level of interaction and make your remote presentations more effective and
      enjoyable for everyone involved!

    <p>
      This is not a data driven-make-money-of-it-app. It's currently running on a private, free
      Supabase instance with no intent to monetize it. We'll let you know here and/or if you sign up
      once we intend to change that – But this is not event on the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>It's simply a side project which is there for you to use and for me to learn Supabase ;)</p>
